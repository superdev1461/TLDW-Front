# PassGuardx

PassGuardx is a simple password manager application built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to securely store website URLs, usernames, and passwords. The application also provides features such as showing/hiding passwords, copying credentials to the clipboard, adding new passwords, deleting individual passwords, and clearing all stored passwords. React Hot Toast is used for providing toast notifications.

## Features

- **Adding Passwords**: Users can add passwords by providing the website URL, username, and password.
- **Secure Password Entry**: The password field hides the entered characters for security purposes.
- **Copying Credentials**: Users can easily copy website URLs, usernames, and passwords to the clipboard.
- **Deleting Passwords**: Users can delete individual passwords or clear all stored passwords.
- **Toaster Notifications**: Toast notifications are used to provide feedback for actions such as adding, deleting, or copying passwords.
- **Password Validation**: The application validates the website URL, ensuring it starts with "http://" or "https://", and checks for disallowed characters in passwords.

## Security and Data Privacy

PassGuardx prioritizes security and data privacy by utilizing client-side storage through `localStorage`. This means that all passwords are securely stored locally on the user's machine and never transmitted to any server. By leveraging the browser's `localStorage` API, PassGuardx ensures that user passwords remain private and inaccessible to anyone other than the user themselves. This approach enhances security and gives users full control over their sensitive information, mitigating the risks associated with storing passwords on remote servers.
